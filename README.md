# project_sinatra_dashboard
let's go for an apartment hunt!

### Sean Luckett
### Dev goals not included in assignment
* ~~Create API using Google Apps Script~~
* ~~Use that API to write job search results to Google Sheet~~
* ~~Implement http basic auth~~
* Deploy to (likely) Heroku
* Incorporate job searches from other sites (ie [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/) or [Hired](https://hired.com/)--also try github jobs and built in colorado)
* Add searchable data store to store results and present them for me to save or discard
* Cron job to run this project on an interval
* Notifier to tell me when new results are ready (twillio is your huckleberry)
